PAIDVU DATA COLLECTORS\n  \n  \n 2.1 Becoming a paidVu data collector. You can only become a paidVu data collector by signing up online at pay.pathvu.com.

PathVu has the right to stop the program at any time without prior notice to participants.\n  \n  \n 2.2 Performing data collection. By collecting data, you agree to use your best efforts, skills and abilities to report data in a professional and workmanlike manner as stated in this agreement.\n  \n  \n 2.3 Evaluation of paidVu data. When you have completed and delivered reported data, PathVu may evaluate the data to determine, in their sole discretion, whether they comply with the requirements of this Agreement. If there are discrepancies with the data reported relative to this agreement, the data collector will not receive the Fee for the data collected, if any.\n  \n  \n 2.4 \n  \n 3. PAYMENT TO PAIDVU DATA COLLECTORS\n  \n The Fee to paidVu data collectors, less any payment processing fees, will be remitted by our third party payment processor, PayPal, each Monday provided that the total amount due to you is at least $5 (the &quot;Minimum&quot;). A paidVu data collector may receive a maximum of $50 in one payment week for the data collected.  A payment week lasts for seven days and ends at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, prior to payment.  Payment shall be paid to the data collector for the previous week of data collection only.  For any week in which the total amount due to you is less than the Minimum, the balance may be carried over to the following week. Unless otherwise stated, all Fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. You are responsible for paying all applicable taxes and for all expenses incurred by you in connection with performing the data collection or otherwise performing your obligations under this Agreement. We may be obligated by law to obtain tax information from you. If we request tax information from you and you do not provide it, we may (in addition to any other rights or remedies available to us) withhold your Fees until you provide this information or otherwise satisfy us that you are not a person from whom we are required to obtain tax information.\n  \n  \n 4. PAIDVU DATA COLLECTOR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR RELATIONSHIP\n  \n  \n For paidVu data collectors, it is understood and agreed that your relationship with PathVu is that of an independent contractor. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or should be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, employment agency, or employer-employee relationship between PathVu and you. You will take no position with respect to or on any tax return or application for benefits, or in any proceeding directly or indirectly involving PathVu that is inconsistent with your being an independent contractor (and not an employee) of PathVu. You are not the agent of PathVu and you are not authorized, and must not represent to any third party that you are authorized, to make any commitment or otherwise act on behalf of PathVu. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:\n  \n  \n 4.1 Benefits and Contributions. You are not entitled to or eligible for any benefits that PathVu may make available to its employees, such as group insurance, profit-sharing or retirement benefits. Because you are an independent contractor, PathVu will not withhold or make payments for social security, make unemployment insurance or disability insurance contributions, or obtain workers\' compensation insurance on your behalf. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, you are reclassified as an employee of PathVu, or any affiliate of PathVu, by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor, or any other federal, state or foreign agency as the result of any administrative or judicial proceeding, you hereby elect not to participate in, on either a prospective or retrospective basis, any employee benefits under any plans or programs established or maintained by PathVu.\n  \n  \n 4.2 Taxes. Since you are an independent contractor and not an employee of PathVu, we do not withhold income or employment taxes or any other amounts from any Fees paid to you under this Agreement. You are solely responsible for filing all tax returns and paying all amounts required by any federal, state, local, or foreign tax authority arising from the payment of Fees to you under this Agreement, and you agree to do so in a timely manner. Because all PathVu Fees are remitted through PayPal, the issuance of a Form 1099-K to you (and the filing of a copy of that Form with the Internal Revenue Service), if any, will be done by PayPal. Please be advised that, in general, all Fees paid to you under this Agreement are considered taxable income, even if you do not receive a Form 1099-K from PayPal, or the amount reported on any such Form 1099-K is less than total Fees paid to you under this Agreement. We recommend that you consult your own tax advisor for information on your personal tax situation.\n  \n  \n 4.3 Compliance with Law. You will comply with all applicable federal, state, local, and foreign laws governing self-employed individuals, including laws requiring the payment of taxes, such as income and employment taxes, and social security, disability and other contributions.\n  \n 5.

No prior or contemporaneous written, oral, and electronic representation, negotiation, or agreement form a part of this agreement, and these Terms of Use, including the PathVu Privacy Policy, as each may be amended by Licensor from time to time, supersede all prior written, oral, or electronic agreements between you and Licensor relating to your access to, and use of, PathVu Services hereunder.\n  \n 8.2 Written Agreement. These Terms of Use constitute a written agreement between you and Licensor. A printed version of these Terms of Use, and of any notice given in electronic form related to this agreement, shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings to the same extent, and subject to the same restrictions, as other business contracts, documents, or records originally generated and maintained in printed form.\n  \n 8.3 Electronic Form of Agreement. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Use.\n  \n 8.4  Modifications To the Agreement. Licensor has the right to modify this Agreement and any policies affecting the PathVu Service, including without limitation the PathVu Privacy Policy. Any modification is effective immediately upon posting by Licensor. Your continued use of the PathVu Services hereunder following notice of any modification to these Terms of Use shall be conclusively deemed an acceptance of all such modification(s). Your only right with respect to any dissatisfaction with any modifications made pursuant to this provision, or any policies or practices of Licensor in providing the PathVu Services, including without limitation any change to the PathVu Content, is to cease using the PathVu Service.\n  \n 8.5  Governing Law.

If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms of Use shall continue in effect.\n  \n 8.8 Relationship Between the Parties. Nothing contained in these Terms of Use shall be construed to constitute you and Licensor as partners or joint venturers or to constitute employment or any type of agency.\n  \n 8.9  Events Beyond Licensor\'s Control.

The headings of the various sections herein are for convenience of reference only and shall not define, limit or otherwise affect any of the terms or provisions hereof.\n  \n 8.11  Mandatory Arbitration. \n UNLESS YOU OPT-OUT, YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND PATHVU (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH PATHVU, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR USE OF THE PATHVU SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION\'S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND PATHVU HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local &quot;small claims&quot; court, if permitted by that small claims court\'s rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor PathVu will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this Agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person\'s account, if PathVu is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be issued to both parties in a writing setting forth in reasonable detail the reasoning for the decision and award and such award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.\n  \n You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor PathVu can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify PathVu in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:\n  Pathway Accessibility Solutions, Inc.\n 1401 Forbes Ave., Ste. 303\n Pittsburgh, PA 15219\n  \n You must include your name and residence address, an email address, and a clear and specific statement that you want to unconditionally opt out of this arbitration agreement.\n  \n If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with PathVu.\n  \n Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, this Arbitration section shall not apply to disputes relating to: (1) your or PathVu\'s intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API Terms; (3) violations of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (4) any dispute in which PathVu is seeking injunctive or equitable relief to prevent further breaches of these Terms of Use by a User.\n \n \n
